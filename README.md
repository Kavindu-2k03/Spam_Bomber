`First setup`
- You must have support for "less secure apps" set to "turn on" on your Gmail. Here is the link to do so: https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
- The program will configure everything else on its own. If the automatic setup fails, you can set it up manually. Along with BoMbEr comes a requirements.txt file. This file contains external dependencies. To install them, you need to open cmd/terminal and write: pip install -r requirements.txt 

**The setup is done!**

`Launch`
* cd Spam_Bomber
* python3 BoMbEr.py

# üìå Discord spammer

To use Discord spammer, you need a preferably empty account that is on the same server as the person you want to spam to. Also, the account must have 2FA turned off. To find the account token, you need to open the developer's tools and in the network tab to find "science" and copy the token in it, here is a screenshot:

* Threads - 40
* Attack time - 30 seconds

# üìå Email spammer

For the email spammer, you need to specify an email and password (email:password) in the emails.txt file. You can specify more than one (each email:password on a new line) to spam from multiple addresses at once.

# üìå Problems and their solutions

If you see something like this:

![wtf4](https://i.ibb.co/XWNtL0S/Screenshot-1.png "no module named") 

This means that you don't have the library that is specified in the error, in this case: "_ctypes". You need to enter in the terminal or cmd:

* pip install the name of the required library (example: pip install _ctypes)
